# Module 19 Challenge: CryptoClustering

## Overview

Welcome to the Module 19 Challenge! In this project, we will use Python and unsupervised learning techniques to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. This challenge will cover several key aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

## Repository

You can find the project repository [here](https://github.com/hxp-pxh/CryptoClustering).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

### Part 1: Data Preparation
- Load the crypto market data from `crypto_market_data.csv`.
- Normalize the data using `StandardScaler`.

### Part 2: Finding the Best Value for k
- Implement the elbow method to find the optimal value for k.
- Visualize the results.

### Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-Means
- Initialize the K-means model with the best value for k.
- Fit the model and predict clusters.
- Visualize the clusters.

### Part 4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Perform PCA to reduce dimensionality.
- Determine the explained variance of principal components.
- Visualize the PCA results.

### Part 5: Optimizing Clusters with PCA Data
- Apply K-means to PCA-transformed data.
- Visualize the clusters in PCA space.

### Part 6: Visualize and Compare Results
- Create composite plots to compare clustering results.

## Objectives

- Utilize unsupervised learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies.
- Implement dimensionality reduction with PCA.
- Visualize and compare clustering results.
